# CZ2006-Project

# Coursework Group Project
Our team has created a native mobile application that suggests things to do or places to visit in Singapore and help them get to those places.

Features include:
- recommending places to the user based on their LatLng.
- allowing user to search for places based on different categories such as names, ratings, location, prices etc. by utilizing real-time data retrieval using **google places API** .
- allowing users to track places they have visited and wish to visit for their ease of reference. 
- allowing users to invite their friends along to the trip.
- allowing users to review places that they have explored.
