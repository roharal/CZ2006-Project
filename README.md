# CZ2006-Project

# Project Description
Our team has created an app that suggests things to do or places to visit in Singapore and help them get to those places.

# Functions
- Suggest places/activities they have enjoyed to their friends. 
- Track places they have visited and wish to visit for their ease of reference. 
- Allow people to discover unique places/activities that they would otherwise have not known about, and help them decide where to go on their next outing.
