# NTU CZ2006 Group Project

# exploreSG
Bored with no plans? Our team has created a native mobile application that suggests things to do or places to visit in Singapore!

Features include:
- recommending places to the user based on their LatLng
- allowing user to search for places based on different categories such as names, ratings, distance, prices etc. by utilizing real-time data retrieval using **google places API**
- allowing users to track places they have visited and wish to visit for their ease of reference
- allowing users to invite their friends along to explore places
- allowing users to review places that they have explored
